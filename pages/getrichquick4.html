<p>Time to get to work.

<p>But, while you go about your day and drive to your first stop, maybe consider that you are only here
    because you already had the knowledge needed to answer the questions, or because you took on the relevant 
    knowledge by going back and learning from your mistakes. 
</p>
<p>Or, you're a really good guesser..
