<h3>Very good! Did you have to start again to make it this far?
</h3>
<p>You are out the van and you're looking at it. Probably wishing you could get in the back again, 
    you need to move on..
</p>
<p>Okay so the next question is... and I swear I'm not thinking of this totally on the spot.. uhhh
</p>
<p>If you climb three quarters of the way up a mountain, and you learn that there is no way to the top 
    via the route you came, what should you do?
</p>
<div class="getrichlinks2">
<a class="getrichquick2" href= "../index.html">Just keep trying and hope a part of
    the mountain falls away via corrosion and your route becomes clear
</a>
<p>OR</p>
<a class="getrichquick2" href="../pages/getrichquick3.html">Turn back, go to the bottom, and start all over again 
    because it is the only way to get to the top.
