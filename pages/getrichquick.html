<h3>You know those job training courses for menial and boring positions, where you have to fill out 
    a multiple choice set of answers, and you weren't really paying attention? And if you fail one question 
    out of twelve, they don't tell you what one you got wrong when you're sent back to the start?
</h3>
<p>Yeah. That.
</p>
<p>If you want to get out of the van and get into the drivers seat, you should pick the right answer.
    You may think that this is completely pointless. 'How could there be a right answer?' I hear you 
    scream. I don't know, just get into the drivers seat.
