<h3>Alright fine, they weren't so easy. I'll give you this one.</h3>
<p>You have worked hard, you have restarted a few times, I may even go as far as to say
    I am proud of you. I'd like to take all the credit, but I suppose you could've given up
    at anytime.
</p>
<p>I think that you deserve the coins, so go on, enjoy your riches..
