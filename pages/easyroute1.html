<h3>Congratulations... you made it to the next step</h3>
<p>You will have to find another 'Next' button if you wish to continue on this
    journey. Giving up won't get you anywhere, however hard it maybe. We might include
    some tricks on this one.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the most obvious answer is the right one, and sometimes it is the wrong
    one, you won't know until you try..
</p>
<p>Trying the same thing as last time works at times, but it depends on the context.</p>
